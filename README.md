# Docker-Compose + Consul + Go ðŸŽ¯

I haven't found too much information on how to setup a Go service and Consul running on top of Docker using `docker-compose`, so I decided to create this little example setup.

1. Start with `docker-compose up`
2. Check the Consul Web-UI on `localhost:8500/ui`
3. Check the Go service on `localhost:8080/` and the 'heartbeat' on `localhost:8080/health` (it return only `200 OK`)
